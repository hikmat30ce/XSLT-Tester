        <li>Added some links to useful W3C docs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Existing features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preview your result as HTML when doctype is set to HTML (see this example)</li>
        <li>Preview your result as PDF when doctype is set to XML and your document starts with root element of XSL-FO. Apache FOP is used to generate the PDF</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Removed features</h2>
     <ul>
